# Spark vs Impala SQL
Comparison of some SQL syntaxes of Spark and Impala

   In this notebook, I try to make a readable and easy-to-use reference for [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) users aiming to explain how to do similar actions in [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/sql/).

I attempted to summarize basic SQL commands and highlight some Spark SQL exclusive statements, comparing them with Impala SQL.
