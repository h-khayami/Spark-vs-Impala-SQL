# Spark vs Impala SQL
Comparison of some SQL syntaxes of Spark and Impala

   In this notebook, I try to make readable and easy to use reference for [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) users aiming to explain how to do similar action in [Spark SQL](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/sql/).

I tried to summerize SQL basic commands and to point out some Spark SQL exclusive statements and compare them with Impala SQL.
